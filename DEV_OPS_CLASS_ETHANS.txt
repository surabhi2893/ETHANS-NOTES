s3 - simple storage service

EC2 elastic compute cloud (VM or instance)
Lambda (all) - server less computing
s3 (specific bucket read) - simple storage service - object storage service.
VPc (Modify rights) -- virtual private cloud.

s3- object is : binary 0,1
ex: pdf, doc, images, videos etc we can store all these data in s3
all data which can be converted to binary form can be stored in s3

and we need to create a bucket in order to save the data in s3, s3 can have max of 200 bucket, and size of bucket is unlimited.
size of object : 0kb to 5TB
we can create bucket for diffrent teams, environment or application ot type.

we need to have obj level policy and bucket level policy.
