s3, bucket creation, uploading the data in it, obj uploading, and go to next> next> we can find these all options there.

S3 storage class
****************
ex: resume is frequestly used, where in marksheet is less used.

1: Standard storage class
		: we can store frequently accessed data, whose retrival rate and cost is high, retrival time is less.
		2.durability is also high : means chances of data loss is less (99.99999999999) upto 11 times.
		3.availability should be high (99.99%)
		
2. Infrequent accessed storage class
		ex: marksheet, logs
		retrival time is normal
		cost is bit low that frequently used data
		durabitlity and availability is similar to stnd storage class.
		
3. Glacier :
		this is used for backup and archive ex: emails, logs, company audit logs, details of emp, bank details etc
		retrival time is very high approx 1 hour (late), more than 5 yrs data.
		cost is less
		durab and availability is same as above.		
		in glacier we keep 3 copies of the objects.
		
4. Glacier deep drive :
		RT is very high 6 hours more than 10 yrs data
		cost is quite less
		rest all features are same.
		
5. Intelligent tier :
		It will intelligently move the data as per we access the data.
		movement will take place only between stand and infrequest ASC.
		there will no cost for movement of data.		

6. One-zone IA :
		data will be stored in only one availability zone.
		ex: 1a and 1b supose a zone in mumbai, so they will have high bandwidth and low latency. for DR and HA purpose.
		in one zone availability is less as data is not available all the time, means we can store only non critical data.
		very less cost.

Life Cycle Rules:

stnd >> IA >> Glacier >> Deep >> One-zone >> intelligently
based on the rules it will keep on moving data from all the levels.

ex: old employee's data.

version:

			we can store varients is file: file 1 : old
											2nd latest
											3rd latest
					
		issues in cersioning in aws : less customization
									   less features	
									   lengthy process
									if we want to go back to the previous version then use : reset/revert command
					however in git version control is done more properly, and it is more customized.
	AWS versioning can be used for docs.

Assignment:
create
index.html, and error.html
hi               hi this is not available

upload both the files in bucket > bucket properties> static website > upload both the files.
